# MFR (Modular File Renderer)

`master` Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer)

`develop` Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer)

A Python package for rendering files to HTML via an embeddable iframe.

### Compatibility

MFR is compatible with Python 3.5 (tested up to 3.5.3) and 3.6.

### Documentation

Documentation available at: http://modular-file-renderer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Setting up

Install the latest version of python3.5.

For MacOSX users:

```bash
brew install python3
# optional, needed for some converters
brew install pspp unoconv
```
For Ubuntu users:

```bash
apt-get install python3
# optional, needed for some converters
apt-get install pspp unoconv
```

After installing python3.5, create the virtual environment with the following commands:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3.5` mfr
pip install setuptools==30.4.0
pip install invoke==0.13.0
invoke install
invoke server
```

### Configuring

MFR configuration is done through a JSON file (`mfr-test.json`) that lives in the `.cos` directory of your home directory.  If this is your first time setting up MFR or its sister project, [WaterButler](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler/), you probably do not have this directory and will need to create it:

```bash
mkdir ~/.cos
```

The defaults should suffice for most local testing.  If you're running the OSF on something other than `http://localhost:5000/`, you'll need to update the `ALLOWED_PROVIDER_DOMAINS` settings value:

```json
{
  "SERVER_CONFIG": {
    "ALLOWED_PROVIDER_DOMAINS": ["http://localhost:9999/"]
  }
}
```

If you encounter the error message `TypeError: throw() takes 2 positional arguments but 4 were given`, you've run into a [core asyncio bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue25394)!  This bug is triggered by turning on debugging. You'll need to set the `SERVER_CONFIG.DEBUG` flag to `false`:

```json
{
  "SERVER_CONFIG": {
    "DEBUG": false
  }
}
```

### Testing

Before running the tests, you will need to install some additional requirements. In your checkout, run:

```bash
invoke install --develop
invoke test
```

### Known issues

- Running `invoke install -d` with setuptools v31 or greater can break MFR.  The symptom error message is: `"AttributeError: module 'mfr' has no attribute '__version__'".`  If you encounter this, you will need to remove the file
`mfr-nspkg.pth` from your virtualenv directory, run `pip install setuptools==30.4.0`, then re-run `invoke install -d`.

- The error `def create_default_context(purpose=ssl.Purpose.SERVER_AUTH, *, cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None): SyntaxError: invalid syntax` is caused by inadvertently running the wrong version of Python. This can be caused by hashing the alias `inv`. To fix this run the command `hash -d inv` then run `inv server`.

- `invoke $command` results in `'$command' did not receive all required positional arguments!`: this error message occurs when trying to run MFR v0.19.0+ with `invoke<0.13.0`.  Run `pip install invoke==0.13.0`, then retry your command.
