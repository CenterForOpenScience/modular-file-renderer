MFR GEO: Modular File Renderer for Geospatial Data
==================================================

The geospation data is rendered using mapbox.js

MFR GEO has support for geojson files that conform to specifications defined here (https://geojson.org). The simplestyle spec defined here (https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec) can be used to alter the symbology of geojson features.

Roadmap:

- Support for ESRI shapefiles (shp)
- Support for Well Known Text (wkt)
- Support for Well Known Binary (wkb)
- Ability to reproject data is not in WGS 84 longitude-latitude
