0.15.0 (2016-08-25)
===================
- Feature: add analytics to MFR requests.  MFR now keeps track of requests, handlers, renderers,
and exporters, with more to come!
- Fix: Better error handling for a number of edge cases. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Docs: many fixes to doc build, layout, and formatting. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Docs: add overview of MFR architecture to docs

0.14.0 (2016-06-24)
===================
- Feature: The Dockerfile now sets up unoconv for you.
- Fix: Character encodings for text files are now detected with the chardet library.  Inspired
by a file that was both valid ISO-8859-1 and UTF-16 at the same time.

0.13.0 (2016-06-17)
===================
- Avoid an unnecessary lookup when MFR's OSF provider gets a WaterButler V1 url for
downloading. (thanks, @pattisdr!)
- Update the install docs to pin invoke to 0.11.1.

0.12.3 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Pin some dependencies and update our travis config to avoid spurious build failures.

0.12.2 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Add a Dockerfile to simplify running MFR in dev environments.
- Pin invoke to v0.11.1.  Our tasks.py is incompatible with v0.13.

===================
- When an invalid provider is passed to MFR, HTML escape the url in the error message.

0.12.0 (2016-05-24)
===================
- MFR now requires python-3.5!  Make sure to set the SERVER_DEBUG flag to false in your server
config to avoid the hated "throw() takes 2 positional arguments but 4 were given" error.
- Tabular files now sort numish columns numerically!  (thanks, @mfraezz!)
- MFR correctly sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header when it receives a request with
an Authorization header but no cookie. IOW it can now be used outside the OSF! (thanks,
@samchrisinger!)
- Text files now wrap on Safari and Chrome. (thanks, @zamattiac!)

0.11.1 (2016-04-19)

Markdown, ReStructred Text, and IPython notebooks. (thanks, @mfraezz!)
- COS is hiring! http://cos.io/jobs (thanks, @AndrewSallans!)
- Update copyright date. (thanks, monotonic progression of time!)
