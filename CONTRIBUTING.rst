In general
==========

- `PEP 8`_, when sensible.
- Test ruthlessly. Write docs for new features.
- Even more important than Test-Driven Development--*Human-Driven Development*.

.. _`PEP 8`: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

In particular
=============


Setting up for development
--------------------------

Clone the repo: ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer.git
    $ cd modular-file-renderer

Install the development dependencies. ::

    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

.. note::

    It is recommended that you use a `virtualenv`_ during development.


Lastly, install mfr in development mode. ::

    $ python setup.py develop

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/

Running tests
-------------


To run all tests (requires pytest) ::

    $ invoke test

You can also use pytest directly. ::

    $ py.test

Writing tests
-------------

Unit tests should be written for all rendering, exporting, and detection code.

Tests can be written as functions, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    # in test_myformat.py

    from mfr_something import render

    def test_render_html():
        with open('testfile.mp4') as fp:
            assert render.render_html(fp) == '<p>rendered testfile.mp4</p>'

There are a few `pytest fixtures`_ to help you mock files. You can use them by simply including them as parameters to your test functions. For example, the ``fakefile`` fixture is a fake file-like object whose name and content you can set to any value.

The above test can be rewritten like so:

.. code-block:: python

    # in test_myformat.py

    from mfr_something import render

    def test_render_html(fakefile):
        assert render.render_html(fakefile) == '<p>rendered testfile.mp4</p>'

.. _pytest fixtures: https://pytest.org/latest/fixture.html

Using the player
----------------

The mfr comes with a Flask app for previewing rendered files. Copy the files you want to render to the ``player/files`` directory then run the app from the ``player`` directory with ::

    $ invoke player

Then browse to ``localhost:5000`` in your browser.

Configuring the player
++++++++++++++++++++++

You will likely want to add additional filehandler modules to the player. The first time you run ``invoke player``, a file is created at ``player/mfr_config_local.py``. You can add additional handlers to the ``HANDLERS`` list and add any additional configuration here.

.. code-block:: python

    # in player/mfr_config_local.py

    import mfr_image
    import mfr_code_pygments

    # Add additional handlers here
    HANDLERS = [
        mfr_image.Handler,
        mfr_code_pygments.Handler,
    ]



Writing A File Format Package
-----------------------------

There are two main pieces of a file format package are

- Your custom rendering and/or exporting code
- Your :class:`FileHandler <mfr.core.FileHandler>`


Rendering/Exporting Code
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Renderers are simply callables (functions or methods) that take a file as their first argument and return a string of the rendered HTML, encapsulated inside of a RenderResult object. Any links to css or javascript associated with the HTML should also be included in the RenderResult object. These links should be passed to the RenderResult object under the "assets" parameter.

Here is a very simple example of function that takes a filepointer and outputs an HTML image tag from it.

.. code-block:: python
    from mfr import RenderResult

    def render_img_tag(filepointer):
        filename = filepointer.name
        content = '<img src="{filename}" />'.format(filename=filename)
        return RenderResult(content)


You can also write renderers as methods.

.. code-block:: python

    # in mfr_video/render.py
    from mfr import RenderResult

    class VideoRenderer(object):

        def render_html5_tag(self, fp):
            content = '<video src="{filename}"></video>'.format(filename=fp.name)
            return RenderResult(content)

        def render_flash(self, fp):
            # ...
            pass


The FileHandler
+++++++++++++++

A file handler is responsible for using your custom rendering and exporting code to actually render and export a file. When you call :func:`mfr.detect <mfr.detect>`, you receive a list of :class:`FileHandler <mfr.core.FileHandler>` classes.

Your FileHandler **must** define a ``detect`` method which, given a file object, returns whether or not it can handle the file.

**Your FileHandler class should be named Handler and should be defined in your ``mfr_format/__init__.py`` file.**

.. code-block:: python

    # in mfr_image/__init__.py

    from mfr import FileHandler, get_file_extension

    # Your custom code
    from mfr_image.render import render_img_tag
    from mfr_image.export import ImageExporter


    class Handler(FileHandler):
        renderers = {
            'html': render_img_tag,
        }

        exporters = {
            'png': ImageExporter().export_png,
            'jpg': ImageExporter().export_jpg,
            # ...
        }

        def detect(self, fp):
            return get_file_extension(fp.name) in ['.jpg', '.png', ]  # and so on



Organization
++++++++++++

Each package has its own directory. At a minimum, your package should include:

- ``__init__.py``: Where your :class:`FileHandler <mfr.core.FileHandler>`` subclass will live.
- ``render-requirements.txt``: External dependencies for rendering functionality.
- ``export-requirements.txt``: External dependencies for export functionality.

Apart from those files, you  are free to organize your rendering and export code however you want.

A typical directory structure might look like this:

::

    mfr-something
    ├── mfr_something
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── configuration.py
    │   ├── render.py
    │   ├── export.py
    │   └── static
    └── tests
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── test_something.py
    ├── dev-requirements.py
    ├── export-requirements.py
    ├── render-requirements.py
    ├── setup.py
    ├── README.rst

where "something" is a file format, e.g. "mfr-image", "mfr-video".

.. note::

    You may decide to make subdirectories for rendering and exporting code if single files start to become very large.


Use a template
++++++++++++++

The fastest way to get started on a module is to use `cookiecutter template`_ for mfr modules. This will create the directory structure above.

::

    $ pip install cookiecutter
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cookiecutter-mfr.git

.. _cookiecutter template: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cookiecutter-mfr



Documentation
-------------

Contributions to the documentation are welcome. Documentation is written in `reStructured Text`_ (rST). A quick rST reference can be found `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_. Builds are powered by Sphinx_.

To build docs: ::

    $ invoke docs -b

The ``-b`` (for "browse") automatically opens up the docs in your browser after building.
