How-To
=========

The tabular component of this application will not work without installing the 
following libraries and python modules.

This was tested using Ubuntu 13.10

```
pip install xlrd
pip install pandas
apt-get install r-base-dev
pip install rpy2
# Open Office file format support
apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev
pip install lxml
pip install ezodf
```

Also requires OpenOffice or a derivative like LibreOffice to work properly.
