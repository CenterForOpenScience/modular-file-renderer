*********

0.22.0 (2017-10-10)
===================
- Feature: Added support for rendering ~50 new plain-text file types via codepygments, including
FASTA files, ImageJ macros, and Turtle files. (thanks, @AddisonSchiller!)
- Feature: Add a unique request ID to MFR's response headers to help with tracking down errors.
- Feature: Add a new task to clean the export and render caches. (thanks, @icereval!)
- Fix: Error more gracefully when missing required query parameters.
- Fix: Make scrollbars visible on IE11 when content overflows the iframe.
- Fix: Fix ALLOWED_PROVIDER_DOMAINS example in MFR docs. (thanks, @jonathon-love for reporting!)
- Code: Teach MFR to listen for a SIGTERM signal and exit immediately upon receiving it. This
bypasses the 10 second wait for shutdown when running it in Docker.
- Code: Add code-coverage checking via coveralls.io. (thanks, @abought!)
- Code: Add Python 3.6 to travis testing matrix. (thanks, @abought!)
- Code: Add a Pull Request template for GitHub. (thanks, @cslzchen!)

0.21.2 (2017-09-13)
===================
- Fix: Update jQuery onload invocation to be compatible with jQuery 3.  (thanks, @sloria!)

0.21.1 (2017-07-20)
===================
- Fix: Quiet some overly-verbose error logging.

0.21.0 (2017-04-07)
===================
- Feature: Turn on scrolling for the MFR iframe to support wide JASP files.
- Fix: Fix rendering of Google Drawing (.gdraw) files by directing them to the image renderer
rather than the unoconv renderer.

0.20.1 (2017-03-02)
===================
- Fix: Cast OSF file size metadata to an int before comparing to our maximum supported file size
limit.  Some providers return file size as a string instead of int.

0.20.0 (2017-03-01)
===================
- The "(thanks, @johnetordoff!)" release
- Feature: The tabular spreadsheet renderer now recognizes date fields as dates and will format
them as such. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Feature: Don't even try to render tabular files larger than 100Mb. Neither the server nor the
browser wants that. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Feature: Render a better error message when encountering a csv file with a single field larger
than ~128kb.  The underlying library can't handle that, so it's polite to let the user know.
(thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Feature: MFR will now render .m4v files using the <video> tag. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Fix: Improve tooltip language on 3d object-renderer. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Code: Start depending on upstream xlrd instead of our own fork. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)

0.19.1 (2017-02-21)
===================
- Fix: explicitly depend on IPython to fix ipynb rendering.  nbconvert and nbformat have an
undeclared dependency on it. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)

0.19.0 (2017-02-02)
===================
- Feature: MFR errors are now categorized and have error-specific metadata added to then.  If Keen
logging is enabled, the error metadata will be logged there for future investigation.
- Fix: The 3D object renderer now imposes a maximum zoom-out limit, so objects can't be shrunk to
infinitesimalness. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Fix: MFR docs are once again building on readthedocs.org! (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Code: Update MFR to use invoke 0.13.0. If you have an existing checkout, you will need to
upgrade invoke manually: pip install invoke==0.13.0 (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Docs: MFR has been verified to work with python 3.5.3 and 3.6.0. From now on, the docs will
mention which python versions MFR has been verfied to work on. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)

0.18.3 (2017-01-11)
===================
- Fix: Increase max codepygments render size to 200kb from 64kb.

0.18.2 (2017-01-04)
===================
- Happy New Year!
- Fix: Be more ruthless about fixing setuptools breakage in Dockerfile. (thanks, @cwisecarver!)

0.18.1 (2016-12-13)
===================
- Pin setuptools to v30.4.0 to avoid package-namespace-related breakage.

0.18.0 (2016-10-31)
===================
- HALLOWEEN RELEASE!
- Feature: Add configurable size limit to text renderer to avoid dumping 100s of MB of text into
the user's browser. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Fix: Pad MFR 404 errors to >512 bytes.  IE discards 404 messages smaller than that and
substitutes its own 404 page. (thanks, @alexschiller!)

0.17.0 (2016-10-11)
===================
- Feature: WaterButler accepts configuration from the environment, overriding any file-based
configuration.  This helps MFR integrate nicer in a docker-compose environment. (thanks, @icereval!)
- Fix: Fix pdf presentation mode on Safari. (thanks, @darioncassel!)
- Fix: Fix aiohttp crashing on gzipped HEAD requests.
- Fix: Fix incorrect WB API usage metrics.
- Code: Bump raven dependency to 5.27.0.

0.16.0 (2016-09-13)
===================
- Feature: MFR now does .sav conversion via pspp-convert instead of rpy2.
- Fix: Update ipython notebook renderer to use split-out nbconvert and nbformat libraries.

0.15.0 (2016-08-25)
===================
- Feature: add analytics to MFR requests.  MFR now keeps track of requests, handlers, renderers,
and exporters, with more to come!
- Fix: Better error handling for a number of edge cases. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Docs: many fixes to doc build, layout, and formatting. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Docs: add overview of MFR architecture to docs

0.14.0 (2016-06-24)
===================
- Feature: The Dockerfile now sets up unoconv for you.
- Fix: Character encodings for text files are now detected with the chardet library.  Inspired
by a file that was both valid ISO-8859-1 and UTF-16 at the same time.

0.13.0 (2016-06-17)
===================
- Avoid an unnecessary lookup when MFR's OSF provider gets a WaterButler V1 url for
downloading. (thanks, @pattisdr!)
- Update the install docs to pin invoke to 0.11.1.

0.12.3 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Pin some dependencies and update our travis config to avoid spurious build failures.

0.12.2 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Add a Dockerfile to simplify running MFR in dev environments.
- Pin invoke to v0.11.1.  Our tasks.py is incompatible with v0.13.

0.12.1 (2016-05-31)
===================
- When an invalid provider is passed to MFR, HTML escape the url in the error message.

0.12.0 (2016-05-24)
===================
- MFR now requires python-3.5!  Make sure to set the SERVER_DEBUG flag to false in your server
config to avoid the hated "throw() takes 2 positional arguments but 4 were given" error.
- Tabular files now sort numish columns numerically!  (thanks, @mfraezz!)
- MFR correctly sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header when it receives a request with
an Authorization header but no cookie. IOW it can now be used outside the OSF! (thanks,
@samchrisinger!)
- Text files now wrap on Safari and Chrome. (thanks, @zamattiac!)

0.11.1 (2016-04-19)
===================
- Require admin to set a whitelist of permitted provider domains, to avoid spamming other sites
with requests.

0.11.0 (2016-04-08)
===================
- IPython notebooks are now styled and look **much** better. (thanks, @erinspace!)
- The OSF (https://osf.io) has moved to Open Sans as the default font, so we shall do the same for
Markdown, ReStructred Text, and IPython notebooks. (thanks, @mfraezz!)
- COS is hiring! http://cos.io/jobs (thanks, @AndrewSallans!)
- Update copyright date. (thanks, monotonic progression of time!)
