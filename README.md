# MFR (Modular File Renderer)

`master` Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer)

`develop` Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/CenterForOpenScience/modular-file-renderer)

A Python package for rendering files to HTML via an embeddable iframe.

### Startup commands

Install the latest version of python3.5.

For MacOSX users:

```bash
brew install python3
brew install pspp
```
For Ubuntu users:

```bash
apt-get install python3
apt-get install pspp
```

After installing python3.5, create the virtual environment with the following commands:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3.5` mfr
pip install invoke==0.11.1
invoke install --develop
invoke server
```
### Testing Configuration (optional)

MFR looks for local configuration in `~/.cos/mfr-test.json`.  The defaults should suffice for most local testing.  If you're running the OSF on something other than `http://localhost:5000/`, you'll need to update the `ALLOWED_PROVIDER_DOMAINS` settings value:

```json
{
  "SERVER_CONFIG": {
    "ALLOWED_PROVIDER_DOMAINS": ["http://localhost:9999/"]
  }
}
```

If you encounter the error message `TypeError: throw() takes 2 positional arguments but 4 were given`, you've run into a [core asyncio bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue25394)!  This bug is triggered by turning on debugging. You'll need to set `SERVER_CONFIG.DEBUG` to `false` in your `mfr-test.json`, e.g.

```json
{
  "SERVER_CONFIG": {
    "DEBUG": false
  }
}
```
